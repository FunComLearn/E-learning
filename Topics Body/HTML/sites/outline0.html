Back to <A HREF="../classes/index.html">Digital Marketing class 
index</A>.<p>

To begin familiarizing yourself with <b>HTML</b> you should spend some
time browsing the web and use the following two options on your web browser:<p>
<ol>
<li>Right click your mouse and select the View Source option<br>
You are now able to view the HTML code that was used to create the
document you are viewing.  Repeat this with a number of different
documents, especially ones that you find have interesting designs.<p>
<li>From the View Source option, select the File option, then select the Save option<br>
This enables you to save a WWW document to your computer's hard drive (by
specifying
c:\filename.html  --- where filename.html can be replaced with anyname
you wish, as long as it finishes with the file extension .htm <b>or</b>
.html).<p> Note: you can save your file in any
directory, use the c:\ drive OR the a:\ drive etc. etc.  The particular
drive or filepath does not matter, as long as you use the same drive
and filepath when viewing the document with your browser.<p>
Note: do not save to a file name beginning with http://www etc. simply
start with the filename you wish to use and end it with the extension .html (htm).<p>
</ol> After the second step is complete (you now have a file saved on your
hard drive):

<ol>
<li>Use the File option again from your web browser. This time
select the Open File option<p>
<li>Select the file name (and filepath) you created above.<br>
Note: alternatively, you can simply type in the filename (and path) in the address box of your 
web browser.

</ol>
You can now view the file you saved to your disk (hard drive).  Your
browser allows you to view documents that are not on WWW (local files).<p>
