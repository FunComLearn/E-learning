<h3>Wrapping Text Around Images</h3>
<span class="text">
<IMG height=10 src="images/pixblue.gif" width=10 align=baseline><b> Wrap Words Around Images</b>    <table border=0 align=left width=175 cellpadding=20 hspace=4 vspace=4><tr><td valign=top><center>    <p><font color=000066><i>    <b><img src="images/01142711.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align=left><br clear=all>     <br>Use   the markup code &lt;BR CLEAR=&#148;left&#148; /&gt; to flow text around images on   opposite sides of your Web pages.</b> </i></font></p>    </center></td></tr></table>      <P>One of the first things you may want   to do is place an image on the page. But how do you make images and words cooperate?  </b>   <br> <br>You can position images on   the page using the ALIGN attribute, and in this case, you can use the Top, Middle,   or Bottom values, as well. The value you choose also will determine how the adjoining   text flows around the image if the graphic is included in a block element, such   as a paragraph &lt;P&gt;, or in a headline, such as &lt;H1&gt;. The default value   is Bottom if no ALIGN value is set.   </b>   <br> <br>Code, such as the HTML elements   and text we present in the following example, will cause the text within the block   to display at the top of the image:  </b>   <br> <br>&lt;IMG SRC=&#148;building.jpg&#148;   ALIGN=&#148;top&#148; /&gt;The first line of this text will be positioned at the   top of the image. The rest will start below the image, creating a large white space.   Fortunately, there is a better way to handle this that more closely resembles what   you could do with a desktop publishing program.   </b>   <br> <br>The text flow problem in the   previous paragraph isn&#146;t as evident when you use the Right or Left value, though.   Thus, the following code will position the image to the right, with the text flowing   neatly on the left side:  </b>   <br> <br>&lt;IMG SRC=&#148;building.jpg&#148;   ALIGN=&#148;right&#148; /&gt;This text flows on the left.</b>     <br> <br><IMG height=10 src="images/pixblue.gif" width=10 align=baseline><b> Double Wraps Are Possible</b>     <br> <br>You can even flow text around an image   placed on the left side of the page and then make the text wrap around a different   image placed on the right side. In this instance, the break element &lt;B /&gt;   and its one attribute, Clear, come into use. Clear, as its name suggests, erases   the alignment it specifies as its value. Therefore, this markup code stops the left-aligned   image setting:   </b>   <br> <br>&lt;IMG SRC=&#148;building.jpg&#148;   ALIGN=&#148;left&#148; /&gt;This text appears to the right of the image.   </b>   <br> <br>&lt;BR CLEAR=&#148;left&#148;   /&gt;  </b>    <table border=0 align=left width=175 cellpadding=20 hspace=4 vspace=4><tr><td valign=top><center>    <p><font color=000066><i>    <b><img src="images/01142712.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0 align=left><br clear=all>       <br>You   can create a buffer around an image by using HSPACE and VSPACE, but in this graphic,   you can see that the space along the left side of the page can be problematic for   your overall design.</b> </i></font></p>    </center></td></tr></table>      <P>Now the right-aligned image   can be specified, and with the following code, the text will start at the top of   the image and flow on the left side:  </b>   <br> <br>&lt;IMG SRC=&#148;building.jpg&#148;   ALIGN=&#148;right&#148; /&gt;This text appears to the left of the image. </b>     <br> <br><IMG height=10 src="images/pixblue.gif" width=10 align=baseline><b> Give Me Some Space</b>     <br> <br>We have seen how to place an image and   run text around it, but the aforementioned methods still don&#146;t have the layout   elegance that&#146;s possible with a desktop publishing program. For one thing,   the text tends to be too close to the image. A buffer space would be nice, and that&#146;s   where HSPACE and VSPACE come into play. HSPACE creates a buffer along the right   side and left side of the image, whereas VSPACE creates a buffer along the image&#146;s   top and bottom.   </b>   <br> <br>These   attributes, introduced by Netscape, were ones that the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)   adopted in 1996 for the HTML 3.2 specification. The HTML 3.2 specification also   let Web designers employ tables and applets.  </b>   <br> <br>If you wish, you can even   set the horizontal and vertical buffer spaces using measurements in pixels. For   example, the markup code for a 50-pixel buffer looks like this:  </b>   <br> <br>&lt;IMG SRC=&#148;Bridge.jpg&#148;   ALIGN=&#148;left&#148; HSPACE=&#148;50&#148; VSPACE=&#148;50&#148;/&gt;  </b>   <br> <br>The problem with HSPACE is   that it inserts a buffer on both sides of the image, so if you want the image flush   against the margin, you are out of luck.</b>     <br> <br><IMG height=10 src=/siteart/pixblue.gif width=10 align=baseline><b> For More Appeal</b>     <br> <br>Although we wish we had more room to   cover this topic further, at least we were able to look at several ways in which   you can use white space and wrap text to create more appealing Web pages. Keep these   methods in mind when your online layout could use a tune-up.   </b>
